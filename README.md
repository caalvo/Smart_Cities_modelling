This project uses `requirements.txt` instead of `environment.yml` because the Python environment was created with `venv` rather than `conda`, making `requirements.txt` the appropriate and lighter choice for Binder.


To view the numbering of the headers as intended go to View > Table of contents or do Ctrl+Shift+K and click on the top left button with three horizontal lines and numbering to disable the auto-numbering.


If running locally, install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
